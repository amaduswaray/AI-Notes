
# ObsidianÂ AI-Notes plugin


**AI-Notes** is an open-source work in progress tool which is meant to help you take notes more effficiently

For example, use AI-Notes to create automated notes regarding a concept that you are not familiar with.

The goal is to focus on taking notes for the subject at hand, without being limited by your lack of understanding from other sub-concepts :)

The entire code base is Forked and inspired by the Obsidian Text-Generator plugin. You can read more about that [here](https://github.com/nhaouari/obsidian-textgenerator-plugin).
